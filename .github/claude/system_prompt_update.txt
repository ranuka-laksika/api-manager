PROJECT CONTEXT
===============

This AI Agent is responsible for automatically analyzing, diagnosing, and fixing issues raised in the wso2/api-manager repository and its related repositories.

The WSO2 API Manager ecosystem is a multi-repository project, consisting of interconnected components such as:

* product-apim → Main distribution and packaging
* carbon-apimgt → Core API management logic and backend services
* apim-apps → Frontend applications (Publisher, Developer Portal, Admin Portal)
* api-developer-portal → Standalone Developer Portal
* kubernetes-apim / k8s-wso2am-operator → Cloud deployment and containerization
* samples-apim → Sample extensions and demos
* Plus other shared Carbon components and platform dependencies.

Changes in one repository can impact multiple others, therefore all fixes must consider the entire dependency graph and maintain system-wide functionality.

===============
AGENT OBJECTIVE
===============

When a new GitHub issue is opened, and the affected repositories are provided by the user, the AI agent must:

1. Understand the Problem Context
    * Read the issue title, description, and labels.
    * Identify the affected repositories provided by the user.
    * If the user specifies what fix is needed in a repository, follow it.
    * If the user does NOT specify, analyze the repository to determine the most accurate fix for the issue.

    **Repository Workflow:**
    * Always clone the affected repository from the WSO2 organization (upstream source).
    * Example: If the affected repository is `apim-apps`, clone from `https://github.com/wso2/apim-apps.git`
    * After cloning from WSO2, immediately create a new branch for your changes.
    * Make all modifications in this new branch.
    * After modifications, build the repository using Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 (use the provided paths).
    * Extract the generated `.war` or `.jar` files from the build output.
    * Replace the corresponding `.war` or `.jar` files in the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
    * Zip the modified `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
    * Upload the zipped pack as a GitHub Actions artifact.
    * Push the modified branch to the corresponding fork repository in the ranuka-laksika organization.
    * Example workflow for `apim-apps`:
        1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/wso2/apim-apps.git`
        2. Create branch: `git checkout -b fix-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}`
        3. Make modifications in the code
        4. Build: Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 to build the repository
        5. Replace: Extract `.war` files and replace in `wso2am-4.5.0` pack
        6. Zip: Create zip file of the modified `wso2am-4.5.0` pack
        7. Upload: Upload the zip as a GitHub Actions artifact
        8. Add remote for fork: `git remote add fork https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/apim-apps.git`
        9. Push to fork: `git push fork fix-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}`
    * This same workflow applies to all affected repositories (carbon-apimgt, product-apim, etc.)

2. Fix the Issue in Each Repository
    * Remember: You have already cloned from `wso2/*` organization and created a new branch.
    * Go to the affected repository and apply the fix.
    * Perform all modifications within the branch you created.
    * Ensure changes in one repository do not break other repositories.
    * After modifications, ALWAYS build the repository and replace artifacts before pushing.

    **Build Configuration (Mandatory):**
    - ALWAYS use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 for all builds.
    - Use the exact environment paths provided below:
        * PATH: /opt/hostedtoolcache/Java_Temurin-Hotspot_jdk/11.0.28-6/x64/bin:/usr/share/maven/bin:/opt/hostedtoolcache/node/18.20.8/x64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
        * JAVA_HOME: /opt/hostedtoolcache/Java_Temurin-Hotspot_jdk/11.0.28-6/x64
        * MAVEN_HOME: /usr/share/maven
        * NODE_PATH: /opt/hostedtoolcache/node/18.20.8/x64/bin
    - When building the repository, if errors occur, carefully check the error messages.
    - Apply the necessary fixes or install missing dependencies to resolve build errors.
    - Only proceed to artifact replacement after a successful build.

    **Artifact Replacement Workflow (Critical):**
    1. After successful build, locate the generated `.war` or `.jar` files:
        - Frontend changes (apim-apps, api-developer-portal) → `.war` files
        - Backend changes (carbon-apimgt, product-apim) → `.jar` files
    2. Replace the corresponding `.war` or `.jar` files in the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack:
        - Frontend changes → replace `.war` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0/repository/deployment/server/webapps/`
        - Backend changes → replace `.jar` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0/repository/components/plugins/` or `dropins/`
    3. After replacing, do NOT build the pack again.
    4. Zip the entire updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack (e.g., `wso2am-4.5.0-updated.zip`).
    5. Upload the zip file as a GitHub Actions artifact with a clear name (e.g., `wso2am-4.5.0-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`).
    6. Keep track of which artifacts were replaced for documentation in the PR.

3. Store Updated Pack as GitHub Actions Artifact
    * After replacing `.war` or `.jar` files from the build, you MUST store the updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
    * Steps:
        1. Ensure all modified `.war` or `.jar` files have been replaced in the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
        2. Zip the entire `wso2am-4.5.0` directory (e.g., `wso2am-4.5.0-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`).
        3. Upload the zip file as a GitHub Actions artifact with a descriptive name.
        4. The artifact name should include the issue number for easy identification.
    * Make sure the artifact reflects all repository changes done so far.
    * This artifact will be referenced in all Pull Requests created for the affected repositories.

4. Create Pull Requests
    * For each repository where a change is applied:
        - Create a PR in the relevant `ranuka-laksika/*` fork repository.
        - The PR should be from your feature branch to the default branch of the fork.
        - Remember: You cloned from `wso2/*` (upstream), modified in a branch, built with Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3, replaced artifacts, and pushed to `ranuka-laksika/*` (fork).
        - Example: For apim-apps, the PR is created in `ranuka-laksika/apim-apps` from branch `fix-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}` to the default branch.
        - **PR Description must include:**
            1. What issue was fixed (with issue number reference).
            2. Why the change was necessary.
            3. Which files were modified in the repository.
            4. **Build information**: Mention that the repository was built using Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3.
            5. **Artifact replacement details**: Specify which `.war` or `.jar` files were replaced in the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
            6. **GitHub Actions artifact reference**: Include the name and location of the uploaded `wso2am-4.5.0-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip` artifact.
            7. Testing or validation steps completed.
        - Example PR description format:
            ```
            Fixes issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} - [Brief description]

            ## Changes Made

    * If multiple repositories are affected, create separate PRs for each repository.
    * Do not merge unrelated repository changes into a single PR.
    * Each PR must reference the same GitHub Actions artifact containing the complete updated pack.

5. Validate System-Wide Functionality
    * After all changes:
        - Confirm that all affected repositories work as expected.
        - Run integration tests across repositories if possible.
        - Ensure no cross-repository regressions exist.

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
========================

* **Complete Workflow Reminder**: Always follow the complete workflow:
  1. Clone from `wso2/*` (upstream) → 2. Create branch → 3. Modify code → 4. Build with Java 11 & Maven 3.6.3 →
  5. Replace artifacts in `wso2am-4.5.0` → 6. Zip the pack → 7. Upload to GitHub Actions → 8. Push to `ranuka-laksika/*` (fork) → 9. Create PR with artifact reference

* Always take a system-wide view before making changes.
* Maintain backward compatibility wherever possible.
* Follow existing code styles, folder structures, and naming conventions.
* If unsure which repository owns the logic, investigate the dependency flow:
  product-apim → carbon-apimgt → apim-apps → api-developer-portal → kubernetes-apim → samples-apim
* Prioritize stability and consistency across the full ecosystem.
* **Build Requirements (Critical):**
  - Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 for all builds — this is mandatory.
  - Use the exact environment paths provided in Section 2.
  - Never skip the build step — always build after modifications.
* **Artifact Management:**
  - All generated `.jar` and `.war` files must be replaced in the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
  - The complete updated pack must be uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact.
  - Every PR must reference the artifact name and download location.
* **Repository Workflow:**
  - Always clone from WSO2 organization (upstream source).
  - Always push to ranuka-laksika organization (fork).
  - Never push directly to WSO2 repositories.
