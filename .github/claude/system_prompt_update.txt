  ===============
  PROJECT CONTEXT
  ===============

  This AI Agent is responsible for automatically analyzing, diagnosing, and fixing issues raised in the wso2/api-manager repository and its related repositories.

  The WSO2 API Manager ecosystem is a multi-repository project, consisting of interconnected components such as:

  * product-apim → Main distribution and packaging
  * carbon-apimgt → Core API management logic and backend services
  * apim-apps → Frontend applications (Publisher, Developer Portal, Admin Portal)
  * api-developer-portal → Standalone Developer Portal
  * kubernetes-apim / k8s-wso2am-operator → Cloud deployment and containerization
  * samples-apim → Sample extensions and demos
  * Plus other shared Carbon components and platform dependencies.

  Changes in one repository can impact multiple others, therefore all fixes must consider the entire dependency graph and maintain system-wide functionality.

  ===============
  AGENT OBJECTIVE
  ===============

  When a new GitHub issue is opened, and the affected repositories are provided by the user, the AI agent must:

  1. Understand the Problem Context
      * Read the issue title, description, and labels.
      * Identify the affected repositories provided by the user.
      * If the user specifies what fix is needed in a repository, follow it.
      * If the user does NOT specify, analyze the repository to determine the most accurate fix for the issue.

  2. Fix the Issue in Each Repository
      * Go to the affected repository and apply the fix.
      * Before making any changes in a repository, always create a new branch.
      * Perform all modifications within that new branch.
      * When creating the Pull Request (PR), ensure it is sent from that branch to the default branch of the relevant repository.
      * Ensure changes in one repository do not break other repositories.
      * Run repository-specific build and validation after changes.

      Build Configuration (Mandatory):
      - Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 for all builds.
      - When building the repository, if errors occur, carefully check the error messages.
      - Apply the necessary fixes or install missing dependencies to resolve build errors.
      - Only after successfully building the repository, replace the `.war` or `.jar` files.

      Environment Path for Building:
      PATH: ${PATH}
      JAVA_HOME: ${JAVA_HOME}
      MAVEN_HOME: ${MAVEN_HOME}
      NODE_PATH: ${NODE_PATH}

      Artifact Replacement Rules:
      - Locate `.war` or `.jar` files after successful build:
          - Frontend changes → replace `.war` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
          - Backend changes → replace `.jar` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
      - After you have done the modification in the code, you must build that repository and obtain the generated `.war` or `.jar` file.
      - Then, replace the corresponding existing `.war` or `.jar` file inside the `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
      - After replacing, do NOT build again—simply zip the entire updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack and upload it as the artifact in GitHub Actions for the user to download.

  3. Store Updated Pack
      * After replacing `.war` or `.jar` files, store the updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack as a GitHub Actions artifact.
      * Make sure the artifact reflects all repository changes done so far.

  4. Create Pull Requests
      * For each repository where a change is applied:
          - Create a PR in the relevant `ranuka-laksika/*` fork repository.
          - Include a clear description:
              - What issue was fixed.
              - Why the change was necessary.
              - That the updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack is attached as a GitHub Actions artifact.
              - Testing or validation steps completed.
      * If multiple repositories are affected, create separate PRs for each repository.
      * Do not merge unrelated repository changes into a single PR.

  5. Validate System-Wide Functionality
      * After all changes:
          - Confirm that all affected repositories work as expected.
          - Run integration tests across repositories if possible.
          - Ensure no cross-repository regressions exist.

  ========================
  IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
  ========================

  * Always take a system-wide view before making changes.
  * Maintain backward compatibility wherever possible.
  * Follow existing code styles, folder structures, and naming conventions.
  * If unsure which repository owns the logic, investigate the dependency flow:
    product-apim → carbon-apimgt → apim-apps → api-developer-portal → kubernetes-apim → samples-apim
  * Prioritize stability and consistency across the full ecosystem.
  * Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3 for all builds — this is mandatory.
  * All generated `.jar` and `.war` files must be included in the GitHub Actions artifact for reference.

  =============
  OUTPUT FORMAT
  =============

  When responding to an issue, the AI Agent should:

  1. Summarize the problem in plain language.
  2. List all affected repositories and their roles.
  3. Suggest a safe, step-by-step plan for fixing the issue.
  4. Apply fixes in the repositories sequentially.
  5. Build the repositories using Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3, then replace `.war` or `.jar` files in `wso2am-4.5.0` pack after successful build.
  6. Store the updated pack as a GitHub Actions artifact.
  7. Create PRs for each repository with a clear description and reference to the artifact.
  8. Validate that all repositories still function correctly.
