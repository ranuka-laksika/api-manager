PROJECT CONTEXT
===============

This AI Agent is responsible for automatically analyzing, diagnosing, and fixing issues raised in the wso2/api-manager repository and its related repositories.

The WSO2 API Manager ecosystem is a multi-repository project, consisting of interconnected components such as:

* product-apim → Main distribution and packaging
* carbon-apimgt → Core API management logic and backend services
* apim-apps → Frontend applications (Publisher, Developer Portal, Admin Portal)
* api-developer-portal → Standalone Developer Portal
* kubernetes-apim / k8s-wso2am-operator → Cloud deployment and containerization
* samples-apim → Sample extensions and demos
* Plus other shared Carbon components and platform dependencies.

Changes in one repository can impact multiple others, therefore all fixes must consider the entire dependency graph and maintain system-wide functionality.

AGENT OBJECTIVE
===============

When a new GitHub issue is opened, and the affected repositories are provided by the user, the AI agent must:

1. Understand the Problem Context
   * Read the issue title, description, and labels.
   * Identify the affected repositories provided by the user.
   * If the user specifies what fix is needed in a repository, follow it.
   * If the user does NOT specify, analyze the repository to determine the most accurate fix for the issue.

2. Fix the Issue in Each Repository
   * Go to the affected repository and apply the fix.
   * Ensure changes in one repository do not break other repositories.
   * Run repository-specific build and validation after changes.
   * Locate `.war` or `.jar` files after build:
     - Frontend changes → replace `.war` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
     - Backend changes → replace `.jar` in the relevant folder under `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.

3. Store Updated Pack
   * After replacing `.war` or `.jar` files, store the updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack as a GitHub Actions artifact.
   * Make sure the artifact reflects all repository changes done so far.

4. Create Pull Requests
   * For each repository where a change is applied:
     - Create a PR in the relevant `ranuka-laksika/*` fork repository.
     - Include a clear description:
       - What issue was fixed.
       - Why the change was necessary.
       - That the updated `wso2am-4.5.0` pack is attached as a GitHub Actions artifact.
       - Testing or validation steps completed.
   * If multiple repositories are affected, create separate PRs for each repository.
   * Do not merge unrelated repository changes into a single PR.

5. Validate System-Wide Functionality
   * After all changes:
     - Confirm that all affected repositories work as expected.
     - Run integration tests across repositories if possible.
     - Ensure no cross-repository regressions exist.

========================
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
========================

* Always take a system-wide view before making changes.
* Maintain backward compatibility wherever possible.
* Follow existing code styles, folder structures, and naming conventions.
* If unsure which repository owns the logic, investigate the dependency flow:
  `product-apim → carbon-apimgt → apim-apps → api-developer-portal → kubernetes-apim → samples-apim`
* Prioritize stability and consistency across the full ecosystem.
* All generated `.jar` and `.war` files must be included in the GitHub Actions artifact for reference.

=============
OUTPUT FORMAT
=============

When responding to an issue, the AI Agent should:

1. Summarize the problem in plain language.
2. List all affected repositories and their roles.
3. Suggest a safe, step-by-step plan for fixing the issue.
4. Apply fixes in the repositories sequentially.
5. Build the repositories and replace `.war` or `.jar` files in `wso2am-4.5.0` pack.
6. Store the updated pack as a GitHub Actions artifact.
7. Create PRs for each repository with a clear description and reference to the artifact.
8. Validate that all repositories still function correctly.
