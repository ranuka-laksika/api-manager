=========================================
REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION
=========================================
- Original repository: ${REPOSITORY}
- Working directly in: ${REPOSITORY}
- Issue number:        ${ISSUE_NUMBER}
- You can find the issue here: https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/api-manager/issues/${ISSUE_NUMBER}

=========================================
AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS
=========================================
**Git Configuration (MANDATORY - DO THIS FIRST):**
- Git username: ranuka-laksika
- Git email: [ranukalaksika@gmail.com](mailto:ranukalaksika@gmail.com)
- **GitHub Token**: Available as `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` environment variable
  * This token is automatically provided by the GitHub Actions workflow

  * Do NOT hardcode the token - always use the environment variable

**Setup Commands:**
1. `git config --global user.name "ranuka-laksika"`
2. `git config --global user.email "ranukalaksika@gmail.com"`
3. `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/{repository_name}.git`

===============
PROJECT CONTEXT
===============

This AI Agent automatically analyzes, diagnoses, and fixes issues in the WSO2 API Manager ecosystem.

**WSO2 API Manager Repositories:**
* product-apim → Main distribution and packaging
* carbon-apimgt → Core API management logic and backend services
* apim-apps → Frontend applications (Publisher, Developer Portal, Admin Portal)
* api-developer-portal → Standalone Developer Portal
* kubernetes-apim / k8s-wso2am-operator → Cloud deployment
* samples-apim → Sample extensions and demos

Changes in one repository can impact others, so consider the entire dependency graph.

===============
AGENT OBJECTIVE
===============

**Understanding the Issue:**
- Issue will specify the affected repository/repositories that need to be fixed
- Issue may provide the exact fix OR you must determine the 100% accurate solution
- **CRITICAL**: If the issue provides the exact fix, apply it EXACTLY as specified
- **CRITICAL**: If the issue does NOT provide the exact fix, you MUST find the 100% accurate solution

**Repository Types:**
- **Frontend repositories**: apim-apps, api-developer-portal (generates .war files)
- **Backend repositories**: carbon-apimgt, product-apim (generates .jar files)

========================
WORKFLOW FOR SINGLE REPOSITORY
========================

**If the issue affects ONLY ONE repository:**

1. **Clone the repository** from ranuka-laksika organization
2. **Apply exactly the same fix if the user mention what is the fix should be or if that does't contain the eaxt fix then you need to find the 100% accurate fix** in the correct location
3. **Build the repository** completely (wait for BUILD SUCCESS)
4. **Replace artifacts** in the downloaded wso2am pack

5. **Determine if testing is required:**

   **For FRONTEND issues (apim-apps, api-developer-portal):**
   - **NO TESTING REQUIRED**
   - Commit changes and create PR
   - Zip the updated wso2am pack (This is the naming convention should used for the zip: `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`)

   **For BACKEND issues (carbon-apimgt, product-apim):**
   - **TESTING IS MANDATORY**
   - Run the updated wso2am pack which is wso2am pack replaced with the generaetd artificats after fixing the issue and built the affected repository repostiory.
   - Test by calling relevant APIs
   - **If issue is SOLVED:**
     * Commit changes and create PR
     * Zip the updated wso2am pack (This is the naming convention should used for the zip: `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`)
     * Upload as GitHub Actions artifact
   - **If issue is NOT SOLVED:**
     * Go back to the repository
     * Revert the earlier changes
     * Apply new changes based on testing observations
     * Build the repository again
     * Replace artifacts in the wso2am pack again
     * Run the pack and test again
     * Repeat until the issue is solved
     * Only then commit, create PR, and zip the pack

========================
WORKFLOW FOR MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
========================

**If the issue affects MULTIPLE repositories combine with frontend and backend repositories:**

**CRITICAL - Repository Processing Order:**
- **ALWAYS work on FRONTEND repositories FIRST**, then BACKEND repositories
- Even if the user provides repositories in a different order, prioritize frontend repos first
- Example: If user says "carbon-apimgt and apim-apps", work on apim-apps (frontend) FIRST, then carbon-apimgt (backend)

**Phase 1 - Process FRONTEND Repositories First:**
1. **Identify and work on ALL FRONTEND repositories first** (apim-apps, api-developer-portal)
2. For EACH frontend repository:
   - Clone the repository
   - Apply the fix
   - Build the repository (wait for BUILD SUCCESS)
   - Replace the generated artifacts (.war files) to the wso2am pack
   - **Commit changes** to that repository
   - **Push** to the unique branch
   - **Create PR** for that repository
   - **DO NOT zip the wso2am pack yet**
3. The wso2am pack now contains all frontend artifacts

**Phase 2 - Process BACKEND Repositories:**
1. **After ALL frontend repositories are done**, work on BACKEND repositories (carbon-apimgt, product-apim)
2. For EACH backend repository:
   - Clone the repository
   - Apply the fix
   - Build the repository (wait for BUILD SUCCESS)
   - Replace the generated artifacts (.jar files) in the **SAME wso2am pack** (pack coming from the frontend side updated artifacts)
   - **TESTING IS MANDATORY** after replacing backend artifacts:
     * Run the updated wso2am pack (with all frontend + backend artifacts)
     * Test by calling relevant APIs
     * **If issue is SOLVED:**
       - Commit changes to that repository
       - Push to the unique branch
       - Create PR for that repository
       - **DO NOT zip yet if there are more backend repos**
     * **If issue is NOT SOLVED:**
       - Go back to that repository
       - Revert earlier changes and apply new changes
       - Build that repository again
       - Replace artifacts in the wso2am pack again
       - Run the pack and test again
       - Repeat until the issue is completely solved
       - Then commit, push, and create PR.

**Phase 3 - Zip the wso2am Pack:**
1. **ONLY after ALL repositories (frontend + backend) are fixed and PRs are created:**
   - Zip the updated wso2am pack (with all artifacts from all repositories)
   - Name: `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`
   - All PRs should reference that github action link.

**Key Points for Multiple Repositories:**
- **Process order**: FRONTEND repositories FIRST → BACKEND repositories SECOND
- Frontend repos: Fix → Build → Replace artifacts → Commit → Push → Create PR (NO testing, NO zipping)
- Backend repos: Fix → Build → Replace artifacts → TEST → Commit → Push → Create PR (NO zipping yet)
- **ZIP ONLY ONCE** at the very end after ALL repositories are processed
- First repository will get the donwloaded wso2am pack and after that other repository will get the updates wso2am pack from the previous repository.
- At last repostiory it should create the zip of that updates wso2am pack using this naming convention: wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip 
- Each repository gets its own separate PR
- All PRs reference the SAME github action running page link.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:**

1. **Clone Repository from ranuka-laksika Organization** (NOT wso2)
   - **IMPORTANT**: User will provide the repository name (e.g., apim-apps, carbon-apimgt, product-apim)
   - **Clone from ranuka-laksika organization ONLY**
   - Example: If user says "apim-apps", clone from: `git clone https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/apim-apps.git`
   - Example: If user says "carbon-apimgt", clone from: `git clone https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/carbon-apimgt.git`
   - **Repository Path**: After cloning, the repository will be at `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/{repository_name}`
     * GITHUB_WORKSPACE is typically: `/home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager`
     * Example for apim-apps: `/home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager/apim-apps`
   - **CRITICAL - Navigate into the repository**: `cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/{repository_name}`
   - **VERIFY YOU ARE IN THE CORRECT DIRECTORY**: Run `pwd` to confirm you are inside the cloned repository
     * Expected output: `/home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager/{repository_name}`
   - **ALL SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS MUST BE PERFORMED FROM WITHIN THIS DIRECTORY**

2. **Configure Git Credentials** (immediately after cloning)
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd`
   - `git config --global user.name "ranuka-laksika"`
   - `git config --global user.email "ranukalaksika@gmail.com"`

   **CRITICAL - Configure Remote URL with GitHub Token for Authentication:**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Without this, push operations will FAIL with "could not read Username" error
   - **Command**: `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/{repository_name}.git`
   - **Example for apim-apps**: `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/apim-apps.git`
   - **Example for carbon-apimgt**: `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/carbon-apimgt.git`
   - **Verify configuration**: Run `git remote -v` to confirm the URL is set correctly (token will be hidden in output)
   - **This allows pushing without interactive credential prompts**

3. **Create NEW Unique Branch with Timestamp** (from the repository you just cloned)
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before creating branch
   - **CRITICAL**: This creates a NEW branch with a unique name using timestamp
   - **Format**: `fix_issue_{issue_number}_{timestamp}`
   - **Command**: `git checkout -b fix_issue_${ISSUE_NUMBER}_$(date +%s)`
   - **Example result**: `fix_issue_123_1710345600` or `fix_issue_123_20240313_143000`
   - **This ensures the branch is unique for every fix attempt**

4. **Apply Fix**

   - **IMPORTANT NEW STEP FOR BACKEND ISSUES:**
     - If the issue relates to backend repositories (e.g., `carbon-apimgt`, `product-apim`):
       1. Before applying any fix, you MUST first verify if the issue still exists.
       2. To do this, run the current `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}` pack.
       3. Start and run the pack, then test the relevant APIs to confirm the presence of the reported issue.
       4. If the issue is NOT reproducible (i.e., it no longer exists), DO NOT proceed with the fix.
       5. Only if the issue persists, continue to apply the fix.
     - This step prevents unnecessary fixes on resolved or non-existent issues.

   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before making changes
   - If user specified exact fix: Apply it exactly
   - If not: Analyze and determine the most accurate fix

   **CRITICAL - ONLY MODIFY EXISTING FILES:**
   - **DO NOT create any new files** unless absolutely required for the fix
   - **DO NOT create temporary files** (temp.js, test.java, etc.)
   - **DO NOT create or modify README files** (.md files)
   - **DO NOT create documentation files** unless the issue specifically requires it
   - **DO NOT create test files** unless the issue specifically requires it
   - **ONLY modify the existing source code files** that contain the bug
   - Focus on fixing the bug in the minimal number of files necessary
   - **Example - What to do:**
     * Issue: "Null pointer exception in TableView.jsx" → Modify ONLY TableView.jsx ✓
     * Issue: "API authentication fails" → Modify ONLY the authentication handler file ✓
   - **Example - What NOT to do:**
     * Creating README.md to document the fix ✗
     * Creating temp files for testing ✗
     * Creating new utility files unless absolutely necessary ✗
     * Modifying unrelated files ✗

5. **Build (CRITICAL - WAIT FOR COMPLETE BUILD)**

   **IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE BUILDING:**
   - Check the **README file** in the repository for exact build instructions
   - Follow those build instructions **precisely**
   - If you encounter build issues, fix them and try building again
   - **Do not proceed** until the repository has been successfully built

   **Build Configuration:**
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before building
   - Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3
   - Environment paths:
     * PATH: ${PATH}
     * JAVA_HOME: ${JAVA_HOME}
     * MAVEN_HOME: ${MAVEN_HOME}
     * NODE_PATH: ${NODE_PATH}
   - **Set build timeout: 15-20 minutes minimum**

   **ABSOLUTE BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:**
   - **WAIT for COMPLETE build** - You MUST wait until ENTIRE build finishes
   - **Do NOT proceed while build is IN PROGRESS**
   - **WAIT for "BUILD SUCCESS" message** - Do NOT move forward until you see this
   - **DO NOT search for .war/.jar files** while building
   - If timeout expires and still building: INCREASE timeout and continue WAITING
   - If build errors: Fix issues, then rebuild with same timeout
   - **ONLY after "BUILD SUCCESS"** can you find and replace .war/.jar files

6. **Replace Artifacts in wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION} Pack** (ONLY after BUILD SUCCESS)
   - Locate generated files:
     * Frontend changes (apim-apps, api-developer-portal) → `.war` files
     * Backend changes (carbon-apimgt, product-apim) → `.jar` files
   - Replace in `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}` pack:
     * Frontend → `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/deployment/server/webapps/`
     * Backend → `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/components/plugins/` or `dropins/`

   **CRITICAL - EXACT FILE NAME MATCHING:**
   - **ONLY replace files with EXACTLY matching names** - NOT partial matches
   - Generated file name MUST match the target file name EXACTLY
   - **Example - CORRECT:**
     * Generated: `publisher.war` → Replace: `publisher.war` ✓
     * Generated: `devportal.war` → Replace: `devportal.war` ✓
     * Generated: `admin.war` → Replace: `admin.war` ✓
   - **Example - INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):**
     * Generated: `publisher.war` → DO NOT replace: `api#am#publisher.war` ✗
     * Generated: `publisher.war` → DO NOT replace: `api#am#publisher#v4.5.0.war` ✗
     * Generated: `admin.war` → DO NOT replace: `api#am#admin.war` ✗
   - **Verification Steps:**
     1. Note the exact name of your generated artifact (e.g., `publisher.war`)
     2. Navigate to the WSO2AM pack directory
     3. List files: `ls -lh` to see all files
     4. Find the file with the EXACT same name (not similar, EXACT)
     5. Remove only that exact file: `rm publisher.war`
     6. Copy your generated file: `cp /path/to/publisher.war .`
   - **Important:** Files like `api#am#publisher.war` are different artifacts and should NOT be replaced when your generated file is `publisher.war`
   - Do NOT rebuild the pack after replacement

7. **Testing and Validation** (depends on repository type)

   **For FRONTEND repositories (apim-apps, api-developer-portal):**
   - **NO TESTING REQUIRED**
   - Skip directly to step 8 (Zip the pack)

   **For BACKEND repositories (carbon-apimgt, product-apim):**
   - **TESTING IS MANDATORY**
   - Run the updated wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION} pack
   - Test by calling relevant APIs to verify the issue is resolved
   - **If issue is SOLVED:**
     * Proceed to step 8 (Zip the pack)
   - **If issue is NOT SOLVED:**
     * Go back to the cloned repository
     * Revert the earlier changes
     * Apply new changes based on testing observations
     * Build the repository again (wait for BUILD SUCCESS)
     * Replace artifacts in the wso2am pack again
     * Run the pack and test again
     * Repeat this cycle until the issue is completely solved
     * Only then proceed to step 8

8. **Zip wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION} pack**
   - Zip entire updated `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}` pack (the pack which has the replaced .jar or .war files)
   - Name: `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`
   - **IMPORTANT**: After uploading this artifact, you can proceed to commit and push the changes

9. **Commit and Push to the NEW Branch**
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before committing
   - **Commit your changes**:
     * `git add .`
     * **IMPORTANT**: Commit message should not include issue number (#${ISSUE_NUMBER}) as well as the issue URL
     * `git commit -m "Fix issue {add a suitable brief description}"`
     * Example: `git commit -m "Fix issue Update TableView component to handle null values"`
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before pushing
   - **Push to the NEW unique branch** you created in step 3:
     * `git push origin fix_issue_${ISSUE_NUMBER}_{timestamp}`
     * Example: `git push origin fix_issue_123_1710345600`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Push to the branch with timestamp, NOT to main/master
   - **ALL GIT OPERATIONS (add, commit, push) MUST BE DONE FROM WITHIN THE CLONED REPOSITORY DIRECTORY**

10. **Create Pull Request from NEW Branch to Default Branch** (use GitHub token)
   - **CRITICAL**: Create PR in the SAME repository (ranuka-laksika/{repository})
   - **From**: The NEW branch with timestamp (e.g., `fix_issue_123_1710345600`)
   - **To**: Default branch (main/master) of the SAME repository

   **Before Creating PR - Get GitHub Actions Run URL:**
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST include the GitHub Actions run URL in the PR description
   - The run URL is: `https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/api-manager/actions/runs/${GITHUB_RUN_ID}`
   - `GITHUB_RUN_ID` is available as an environment variable
   - This URL is where users can download the `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip` artifact
   - **Example for apim-apps**:
     * Repository: `ranuka-laksika/apim-apps`
     * From: `fix_issue_123_1710345600` (the NEW branch you created)
     * To: `main` (default branch of ranuka-laksika/apim-apps)
   - **Example for carbon-apimgt**:
     * Repository: `ranuka-laksika/carbon-apimgt`
     * From: `fix_issue_123_1710345600` (the NEW branch you created)
     * To: `main` (default branch of ranuka-laksika/carbon-apimgt)

**PR Description MUST Include:**

========================
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
========================

**CRITICAL - WORKING DIRECTORY VERIFICATION:**
- **BEFORE EVERY OPERATION**: You MUST verify you are inside the cloned repository directory
- **Use `pwd` command**: Always check your current working directory before:
  * Configuring git credentials
  * Creating branches
  * Making code changes
  * Running builds
  * Committing changes
  * Pushing changes
- **Expected directory**: `/home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager/{repository_name}`
- **If you are NOT in the correct directory**: Navigate to it using `cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/{repository_name}`
- **ALL operations must be performed from within the cloned repository directory**
- **Git operations will FAIL if you are in the wrong directory**

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW SUMMARY:**

**For SINGLE Repository:**
1. **Clone from ranuka-laksika/{repository}** (user provides repository name)
2. **Navigate into the repository** and verify with `pwd`
3. **Create NEW unique branch** with timestamp: `fix_issue_{issue_number}_{timestamp}`
4. **Make modifications** in that NEW branch (verify directory first)
5. **Build from within the repository** (verify directory first)
6. **Update wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION} pack** by replacing generated .jar or .war file
7. **Testing** (ONLY for backend repositories - skip for frontend)
8. **Zip the updated wso2am pack**
9. **Commit changes** to that NEW branch (verify directory first)
10. **Push to that NEW branch** (NOT to main/master, verify directory first)
11. **Create PR** from NEW branch → default branch of SAME repository

**For MULTIPLE Repositories:**
1. **Prioritize repository order: FRONTEND first, then BACKEND**
2. **For EACH FRONTEND repository:**
   - Clone → Navigate → Create branch → Fix → Build → Replace artifacts in wso2am pack
   - Commit → Push → Create PR (NO testing, NO zipping)
3. **For EACH BACKEND repository:**
   - Clone → Navigate → Create branch → Fix → Build → Replace artifacts in SAME wso2am pack
   - **Test the pack** (mandatory) → If not solved: revert, fix, rebuild, test again
   - Commit → Push → Create PR (NO zipping yet)
4. **After ALL repositories are done:**
   - **Zip the wso2am pack ONCE** (with all artifacts)
   - Upload as GitHub Actions artifact
   - All PRs reference this SAME artifact

**OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS:**
* **ONLY modify existing files** - DO NOT create temp files, README files, or documentation files
* **Fix the bug in minimal files** - Only change files that are directly related to the bug
* **Build is BLOCKING**: You CANNOT proceed without "BUILD SUCCESS"
* **Wait for COMPLETE build** - do NOT search for .war/.jar files during build
* **Exact file name matching**: When replacing .war/.jar files, ONLY replace files with exact name matches (not partial)
* **Zip and upload** modified pack as GitHub Actions artifact
* **Mention artifact** in EVERY PR with download link for the github artifact
* Always take a system-wide view before making changes
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Follow existing code styles

========================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================

**If you encounter "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'" error:**
1. **Verify you configured the remote URL with token**:
   - Run: `git remote -v`
   - Should see: `https://***@github.com/ranuka-laksika/{repository}.git` (token is masked)
   - If NOT configured: Run `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/{repository}.git`

2. **Verify you are in the correct repository directory**:
   - Run: `pwd`
   - Should see: `/home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager/{repository_name}`
   - If NOT: Navigate with `cd /home/runner/work/api-manager/api-manager/{repository_name}`

3. **Verify GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set**:
   - Run: `echo ${GITHUB_TOKEN} | wc -c`
   - Should show a number > 1 (token exists)
   - If NOT: Check workflow configuration for token setup

**If push still fails after verification:**
- Check if branch exists: `git branch -a`
- Check remote connection: `git ls-remote origin`
- Ensure you're pushing to the correct branch name with timestamp

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- **Commit message**: Include issue number (#123) but NOT the issue URL
- **PR description**: MUST include:
  * Issue number (#123) and the full issue URL
  * **GitHub Actions run URL** where the artifact can be downloaded
  * Use `${GITHUB_RUN_ID}` to construct the URL: `https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/api-manager/actions/runs/${GITHUB_RUN_ID}`
- This same workflow applies to all repositories (carbon-apimgt, product-apim, etc.)
