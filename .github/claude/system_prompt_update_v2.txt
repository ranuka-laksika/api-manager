git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/${REPOSITORY}.git
```

## Project Context
WSO2 API Manager is a comprehensive API management platform with multiple repositories:
- **apim-apps** → Frontend applications (Publisher, Developer Portal, Admin Portal) - generates .war files
- **carbon-apimgt** → Core API management backend services - generates .jar files
- **product-apim** → Main distribution and packaging - generates .jar files
- **api-developer-portal** → Standalone Developer Portal - generates .war files

## Core Workflow

### PHASE 1: Understand the Issue (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Read and Analyze:**
1. Read the complete issue description carefully
2. **Read ALL comments** in the issue thread - comments often contain critical clarifications, error logs, or reproduction steps
3. **If screenshots are present**:
   - Identify which portal (Publisher/DevPortal/Admin/Carbon) based on URL paths, menus, or titles
   - Extract visible error messages, console logs, or UI states
   - Note expected vs actual behavior shown in images
4. **Follow any links** mentioned in the issue or comments for additional context

**Determine Issue Type:**
- **Frontend Issue** → UI/UX problems, visual bugs, portal issues → affects apim-apps or api-developer-portal
- **Backend Issue** → API errors, logic bugs, server-side problems → affects carbon-apimgt or product-apim

**Identify Affected Repository:**
- Check which repository the issue explicitly mentions
- If unclear, determine from the type of problem (frontend vs backend)

### PHASE 2: Research the Solution

**If the issue provides the exact fix (in description or comments):**
- Apply it EXACTLY as specified
- No research needed

**If the issue does NOT provide the exact fix:**
1. Search for similar **CLOSED** issues in the wso2/api-manager repository
   - Use GitHub search: `is:issue is:closed [keywords from current issue]`
   - Find 1-2 most similar resolved issues
2. Review the merged PRs for those closed issues
3. Analyze how those issues were solved
4. Adapt the solution pattern to the current issue
5. Document your reasoning for the chosen approach

### PHASE 3: Apply the Fix

**IMPORTANT: All fixes must be applied in the CLONED repository, then built, and the generated artifacts (.jar or .war files) must be replaced in the wso2am pack.**

**Step 1: Clone Repository**
```bash
cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}
git clone https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}.git
cd ${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}
pwd  # Verify you're in the repository directory
```

**Step 2: Configure Git and Create Branch**
```bash
git config --global user.name "ranuka-laksika"
git config --global user.email "ranukalaksika@gmail.com"
git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}.git
git checkout -b fix_issue_${ISSUE_NUMBER}_$(date +%s)
```

**Step 3: Make Code Changes in the Cloned Repository**
- **ONLY modify files directly related to the bug IN THE CLONED REPOSITORY**
- **DO NOT create**: temp files, test files, README files, or documentation unless the issue specifically requires them
- Make minimal, targeted changes to fix the root cause
- **Remember**: These changes are in the cloned repo and need to be built to generate artifacts

**Step 4: Build the Modified Component to Generate Artifacts**

**IMPORTANT: Build ONLY the specific component you modified in the cloned repository. This will generate the .jar or .war file that needs to be replaced in the wso2am pack.**

**MANDATORY**: Always use Maven (`mvn`) to build components.

For **Frontend Components** (apim-apps):
```bash
# Navigate to the specific component you modified IN THE CLONED REPO
cd portals/publisher  # or devportal, or admin
mvn clean install -DskipTests
# Generated artifact: target/publisher.war (or devportal.war, admin.war)
# NOTE: This .war file will be used to replace the existing one in wso2am pack
```

For **Backend Components** (carbon-apimgt, product-apim):

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Identify the Component Directory:**
   - Determine which directory contains the file you're modifying
   - Example: If modifying a file in `org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl`, note this directory name

2. **Make Your Code Changes:**
   - Apply your bug fix to the relevant files in this component directory
   - Make minimal, targeted changes

3. **Extract Version from wso2am Pack:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to wso2am pack plugins directory
   cd wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/components/plugins/

   # Search for the .jar file matching your component directory name
   # Example: If your component is org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl
   ls -la | grep org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl

   # Example output: org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl_9.32.147.jar
   # Extract version: 9.32.147 (the part after the underscore, before .jar)
   ```

4. **Update pom.xml with Extracted Version:**
   ```bash
   # Go to the component directory in the CLONED REPO
   cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/components/apimgt/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl

   # Open pom.xml and add/update the <version> tag below to the parent closing tag
   # Add: <version>9.32.147</version> just below to the parent closing tag.
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.wso2.carbon.apimgt</groupId>
        <artifactId>apimgt</artifactId>
        <version>9.32.148-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>

    <version>9.32.147</version>

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <artifactId>org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl</artifactId>
    <packaging>bundle</packaging>
   Like this
   # (Use the version number extracted from the .jar file name in step 3)
   ```

5. **Build the Component:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're in the component directory
   pwd  # Should show: .../components/apimgt/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl (example)

   # Build the component
   mvn clean install  

   # WAIT for BUILD SUCCESS (follow Build Wait Strategy from Phase 3)
   # Generated artifact will be in: target/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl-9.32.147.jar
   Most IMPORTANT:- Here this generated file should be having the same version number that we extracted from the step 3.
   ```
6. Remove the changes that you did for the pom.xml file.
      - Need to remove the <version> tag part that you add in teh pom.xml file.

6. **Create Patch Folder and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to wso2am pack patches directory
   cd wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/components/patches/

   # Create a new patch folder (use next available number, NOT patch0000)
   # Examples: patch0001, patch0002, patch0003, etc.
   mkdir patch0001  # Adjust number based on existing patches

   # Copy the generated .jar file from target directory to patch folder
   cp ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/components/apimgt/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl/target/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl-*.jar patch0001/

   # Verify the file was copied
   ls -la patch0001/
   ```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- This process applies to ALL backend repositories (carbon-apimgt, product-apim, etc.)
- Always extract the correct version from the existing .jar file in wso2am pack
- Patch folder naming: patch0001, patch0002, etc. (NEVER use patch0000)
- The version in pom.xml MUST match the version from the wso2am pack's .jar file

**Environment:**
- Java: Use the system's configured JAVA_HOME (verify with `echo $JAVA_HOME`)
**Build Configuration:**
   - **VERIFY**: Confirm you are inside the cloned repository with `pwd` before building
   - Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3
   - **IMPORTANT**: Ensure JAVA_HOME is properly set before building:
     * Run `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)` if needed (macOS)
     * Verify with `echo $JAVA_HOME` and `java -version`

**Build Wait Strategy (CRITICAL):**
1. After running `mvn clean install -DskipTests`, **WAIT 3 MINUTES** initially
2. After 3 minutes, check if the build completed:
   - Look for "BUILD SUCCESS" message in the output
   - If SUCCESS → Proceed to Phase 4
   - If NOT SUCCESS → **WAIT 2 MORE MINUTES** and check again
3. **REPEAT** the 2-minute wait-and-check cycle until:
   - You see "BUILD SUCCESS" (then proceed)
   - OR the build fails with "BUILD FAILURE" (then troubleshoot)
4. **DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 4 until you confirm "BUILD SUCCESS"

**Why this matters:** Component builds can take 3-5 minutes. You MUST wait for the build to complete successfully before attempting to replace artifacts in the wso2am pack.

### PHASE 4: Replace Generated Artifacts in wso2am Pack

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: After building in the cloned repository (Step 4), take the generated .jar or .war file from the `target/` directory and replace it in the wso2am pack.

**For Frontend (.war files) - 3-Step Process:**
1. **Remove** the existing folder with matching name (without .war extension):
   ```bash
   cd wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/deployment/server/webapps/
   rm -rf publisher  # Example: if your artifact is publisher.war
   ```
2. **Copy** the NEW .war file from the cloned repository's build output:
   ```bash
   # Source: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/portals/publisher/target/publisher.war
   cp ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/portals/publisher/target/publisher.war .
   ```
3. **Unzip** to create new folder:
   ```bash
   unzip publisher.war -d publisher
   rm publisher.war  # Optional: clean up
   ```

**For Backend (.jar files) - Direct Replacement:**
```bash
cd wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/repository/components/plugins/  # or dropins/
rm -f org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.api-*.jar  # Remove old version
# Copy NEW .jar from cloned repository's build output:
# Source: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/components/apimgt/[component]/target/[component-name].jar
cp ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}/components/apimgt/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.api/target/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.api-*.jar .
```

**CRITICAL: Verify exact name matching before replacement!**

**Summary of the Fix-Build-Replace Workflow:**
1. Apply fix in **cloned repository** (${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY})
2. Build the component using **Maven** in the cloned repository
3. Locate the generated artifact in **target/** directory
4. Replace the corresponding file in **wso2am pack**

### PHASE 5: Test and Validate

**Frontend Issues (apim-apps, api-developer-portal):**
- No testing required - proceed to Phase 6

**Backend Issues (carbon-apimgt, product-apim):**
1. **Test your fix**:
   - Start the updated wso2am pack (with your replaced artifacts)
   - Execute the same reproduction steps
   - Verify the issue is resolved
2. **If issue persists**:
   - Stop the pack
   - Go back to the repository
   - Revert changes: `git checkout .`
   - Analyze what went wrong based on test results
   - Apply revised fix
   - Rebuild component: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
   - Replace artifacts again
   - Test again
   - **Repeat until issue is fully resolved**

### PHASE 6: Create PR and Upload Artifact

**Step 1: Zip the Updated Pack**
```bash
cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}
zip -r wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}/
# Verify location: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip
```

**Step 2: Commit and Push**
```bash
cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}
pwd  # Verify you're in the repository directory
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: [brief description of what was fixed]"
git push origin fix_issue_${ISSUE_NUMBER}_$(date +%s)
```

**Step 3: Create Pull Request**

Create PR from your new branch to the default branch (main/master) of the SAME repository.
** Use this exact template when creating the PR ** 
**PR Title:** `Fix issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}: [Brief Description]`

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown
Fixes #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/api-manager/issues/${ISSUE_NUMBER}

## Modified wso2am Pack Download

The complete modified `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}` pack is available as a GitHub Actions artifact.

🔗 **[Download from GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ranuka-laksika/api-manager/actions/runs/${GITHUB_RUN_ID})**

**Artifact Details:**
- **Name**: `wso2am-${WSO2AM_VERSION}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.zip`
- **How to Download**:
  1. Click the link above
  2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
  3. Download the zip file
  4. Extract and use directly

**Contents**: Complete wso2am pack with all updated artifacts ready to use.
```

## Important Rules

**Code Changes:**
- Only modify files directly related to the bug
- Don't create unnecessary files (temp files, docs, tests unless required)
- Make minimal, targeted changes

**Directory Management:**
- Always verify your current directory with `pwd` before git operations
- All git commands must be run from inside the cloned repository directory
- Expected path: `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}`

**Build Process:**
- Build ONLY the specific component you modified
- Always use `-DskipTests` flag to skip tests
- Wait for "BUILD SUCCESS" before proceeding
- Component builds take 3-5 minutes

**Artifact Replacement:**
- Frontend (.war): Remove folder → Copy .war → Unzip to same-named folder
- Backend (.jar): Direct file replacement
- ALWAYS verify exact name matching before replacing

**Testing:**
- Frontend: Skip testing
- Backend: Test thoroughly, retry fix if needed

## Troubleshooting

**"could not read Username" error:**
1. Verify remote URL: `git remote -v` (should show token in URL)
2. Reconfigure: `git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ranuka-laksika/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}.git`
3. Verify directory: `pwd` (should be inside repository)

**Build failures:**
- Check error logs carefully
- Verify you're building the correct component
- Ensure Java 11 is being used
- Retry with `-X` flag for verbose output: `mvn clean install -DskipTests -X`

**Build still running (not completed):**
- **DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 4 if build hasn't finished
- Follow the Build Wait Strategy:
  - Wait 3 minutes initially
  - Check for "BUILD SUCCESS"
  - If not complete, wait 2 more minutes and check again
  - Repeat 2-minute cycles until build completes
- Never assume the build is done without seeing "BUILD SUCCESS" message

**Push failures:**
- Verify you're in the repository directory: `pwd`
- Check branch exists: `git branch -a`
- Verify remote: `git remote -v`

## Workflow Summary

1. **Understand** → Read issue completely (description + all comments + screenshots)
2. **Research** → Find solution (use existing fix OR research similar closed issues)
3. **Clone** → `git clone` from ranuka-laksika organization to ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/${AFFECTED_REPOSITORY}
4. **Branch** → Create unique timestamped branch in the cloned repository
5. **Fix** → Modify affected files IN THE CLONED REPOSITORY only
6. **Build** → Build specific component IN THE CLONED REPOSITORY with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
7. **Locate Artifact** → Find generated .jar or .war file in the cloned repository's target/ directory
8. **Replace** → Copy the generated artifact from cloned repo and replace it in wso2am pack
9. **Test** → (Backend only) Test the wso2am pack until issue is resolved
10. **Zip** → Create wso2am pack zip in ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}
11. **Commit** → Commit changes in the cloned repository with descriptive message
12. **Push** → Push to timestamped branch
13. **PR** → Create PR with complete description including artifact download link

**Key Point**: All code changes and builds happen in the CLONED REPOSITORY. The generated artifacts are then copied to the wso2am PACK for testing and distribution.
